A good friend Steve and his family would like to invest on green energy, specifically, DAQO New Energy Corporation, however like any smart investor they would like additional data. They would like to be able to look at other potential investment and be able to run the same report more efficiently for other stock market over the last few years.

### Purpose

## Summary

### Advantages of refactoring code
Refactoring is not as time consuming as building the codes from scratch. It allows you to look at the codes and re-organize or re-format in a way that is more user friendly which is beneficial when onboarding a new user to an existing report. It helps run the report more efficiciently since you are able to hopefully reduce the code size. Its a good opportunity to add new features and functionalities as needed.
      
### Disadvantages of refactoring code
Refactoring may be a disadvantage when a new sets of bugs is introduced while in pursuit of reducing code sizes. It can also be a disadvatage if it causes you miss your deadline since its an additional time investment. In some cases its possible that an original file is so poorly written that it may be more efficient to write a new set of codes than to try to decipher and re-write. 

### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
In refractoring the original VBA, the time had reduced from __ to __ for 2018 data. It is also much more user friendly for anyone jumpis ing in that looking into how the codes are written. On the downside, it took another three days to complete the refractoring and a new set of bugs were introduced. In addition to my time to complete this project, I needed additional help from a one on one tutor to help address those errors.
